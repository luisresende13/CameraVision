# CameraVision

CameraVision is a powerful Python Flask API designed for real-time object detection and identification in camera streams. This open-source project harnesses the capabilities of state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms and machine learning models to analyze video feeds, accurately detect objects of interest, and provide real-time identification results.

## Features

- **Real-time object detection:** CameraVision utilizes cutting-edge computer vision techniques to detect objects in live camera streams, enabling real-time analysis of video content.
- **Object identification:** With the help of machine learning models, CameraVision can accurately identify various objects present in the video feed, providing valuable insights and actionable information.
- **Scalability and flexibility:** Built on the Flask framework, CameraVision offers a scalable and flexible API that can be easily integrated into existing applications or deployed as a standalone service.
- **Easy integration:** The API is designed with simplicity in mind, allowing developers to quickly integrate it into their projects and leverage its object detection and identification capabilities.
- **Extensibility:** CameraVision is built using modular and extensible code, making it easy to customize and extend the functionality to suit specific requirements.

## Web App

In addition to the API, CameraVision includes a web application that provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the object detection and identification functionality. The web app allows users to easily configure camera streams, set detection parameters, and visualize the results in real-time. It provides an intuitive way to monitor and analyze video feeds for object identification purposes.
